# (Inspired by) Rinha de Backend 2023

## ðŸ“– About
This project was inspired by [Rinha de Backend 2023](https://github.com/zanfranceschi/rinha-de-backend-2023-q3). 
I haven't submitted it since I found it 2 days before the due date, so it was created as an inspiration to simulate 
similar scenarios using Kotlin with Spring Boot in a reactive way, connecting with a Postgres database with R2DBC and 
using a local cache.

I chose K6 to run the load tests since I wanted to explore the tool better.

This project has several limitation and was built just for fun.
